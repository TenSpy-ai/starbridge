## Standard Payload Email (Tier 1 — Report Only)

**Subject**: Custom intelligence report for {Company}

```
Hi {FirstName},

Thanks for your response — we put together a custom intelligence 
report for {Company} based on procurement signals we're tracking.

[SCREENSHOT OF REPORT]

Here's the full report: {ReportURL}

We've identified decision-maker contacts and additional signals 
we'd love to share on a quick call. Do you have 15 minutes 
this week?

Best,
{BDRName}
```

**Notes:**
- "Decision-maker contacts and additional signals" creates a reason to take the call even though the report is free
- Screenshot goes inline above the link — visual hook before the click
- Keep short — SLED buyers are busy, long emails get skimmed

## Payload Email with DM (Tier 2)

**Subject**: Custom intelligence report for {Company}

```
Hi {FirstName},

Thanks for your response — we put together a custom intelligence 
report for {Company} based on procurement signals we're tracking.

[SCREENSHOT OF REPORT]

Here's the full report: {ReportURL}

We've also identified {DMName}, {DMTitle} as a key stakeholder 
for this initiative. Happy to share more context on navigating 
this procurement process — do you have 15 minutes?

Best,
{BDRName}
```

**Notes:**
- Mentioning the DM by name/title in the email signals depth of research — adds credibility
- Don't include the DM's email/phone in the email to the prospect (that's for the call)

## Payload Email with Gameplan (Tier 3)

**Subject**: {Company} — procurement signals and intelligence

```
Hi {FirstName},

Thanks for getting back to us. We've been tracking procurement 
activity at {Company} and put together a custom report:

[SCREENSHOT OF REPORT]

Full report: {ReportURL}

A few things that stood out:
- {Signal1Summary — 1 sentence}
- {Signal2Summary — 1 sentence}

We've identified the key decision makers and can walk through 
how to position this in their current procurement cycle. 
Do you have 15 minutes this {Day}?

Best,
{BDRName}
```

**Notes:**
- Tier 3 emails can be slightly longer because the analysis adds value
- Pull the 1-2 most compelling signal summaries directly (don't copy the whole report)
- Still drive to the call — the email sells the meeting, not the product

## DM-Later Follow-Up Email

Sent when DM info arrives after the initial payload email.

**Subject**: RE: Custom intelligence report for {Company}

```
Hi {FirstName},

Quick follow-up — we've also identified the key decision maker 
for this initiative at {Company}:

{DMName}, {DMTitle}

Happy to share their contact details and walk through the 
procurement landscape on a call. What does your schedule 
look like?

Best,
{BDRName}
```

## Voicemail Script (Nooks Call — No Answer)

```
Hi {FirstName}, this is {BDRName} from Starbridge. 

I just sent over a custom intelligence report for {Company} 
with some procurement signals I think you'll find interesting. 

Check your inbox — and feel free to reach out if you'd like 
to walk through it. Thanks!
```
