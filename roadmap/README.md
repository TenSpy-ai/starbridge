# Roadmap

Phased delivery plan for the Starbridge GTM pipeline. V1 is the trial deliverable; V2 is what earns the full engagement.

## Index

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [v1-mvp.md](./v1-mvp.md) | Trial period deliverable — must ship by Friday 2/7 |
| [v2-scale.md](./v2-scale.md) | Post-trust scope — what comes after the trial |
| [ideas-parking-lot.md](./ideas-parking-lot.md) | Ideas captured but not committed — prevents scope creep |

## Work in Progress

The [WIP/agent-pipeline/](./WIP/agent-pipeline/) directory contains the 19-step intel report pipeline — interactive playground, agent architecture, SDK reference, and prompt specs. See [WIP/agent-pipeline/README.md](./WIP/agent-pipeline/README.md) for details.
