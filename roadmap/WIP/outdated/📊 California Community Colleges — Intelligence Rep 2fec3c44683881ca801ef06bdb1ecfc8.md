# 🎯 Relevancy Analysis

<aside>
🔥

**Use Case Archetype:** Scale & Equity — Career Services Access

</aside>

The CCC system's **Vision 2030** framework explicitly targets workforce development and student success outcomes across all 116 community colleges. Several signals point to a strong VMock fit:

- The Board of Governors is prioritizing **Career Technical Education (CTE)** pathways and workforce alignment, with a Senior Advisor to the Chancellor specifically focused on "Workforce Development, Strategic Partnerships, and GenAI."
- The system is investing in a **Common Cloud Data Platform** designed to unify student analytics. This infrastructure would make VMock integration seamless — plugging AI-powered career tools into a centralized student data layer.
- The Chancellor's Office has identified that decentralized, college-level systems create inequity: smaller rural colleges lack the resources to build modern career services at scale. VMock's platform-as-a-service model solves this by giving every college the same AI career tools regardless of local IT capacity.

**Primary DM Target:** Don Harjo Daves-Rougeaux — Senior Advisor to the Chancellor on Workforce Development, Strategic Partnerships, and GenAI

**Email:** [ddaves-rougeaux@cccco.edu](mailto:ddaves-rougeaux@cccco.edu)

**Why this contact:** His role literally spans the three pillars that VMock addresses — workforce outcomes, partnership procurement, and GenAI adoption. He's the bridge between the Chancellor's strategic vision and the technology stack that delivers it.

## Outreach Script

"The CCC system is building a unified cloud platform to serve 2.1 million students equitably. VMock can plug directly into that infrastructure as the AI career acceleration layer — giving every college in the system instant access to resume optimization, career pathway mapping, and employer-aligned skills analysis. Instead of each of the 116 colleges building separate career tech, VMock delivers it at system scale."

## Procurement Path

**Recommended:** Cooperative purchasing via **CollegeBuys** (Foundation for California Community Colleges). This is CCC's preferred procurement channel for system-wide technology agreements.

**Sole Source Threshold:** <$114,500 per district

**Key Resellers:** CDW-G, SHI International, Carahsoft, Connection (GovConnection)

**Procurement Hell Score:** 58/100 — moderate difficulty. Co-op route strongly recommended.

# 📡 Recent Strategic Signals

## Vision 2030 — Common Cloud Data Platform

The Board of Governors has approved a "demonstration project" to create a shared data infrastructure across all 116 colleges. This platform will enable near-real-time student analytics and automated data sharing — a natural integration point for VMock's AI career tools.

## CCCApply Modernization

A major digital transformation to upgrade the system-wide application portal. Goal: reduce student "drop-off" rates through streamlined workflows and better outreach analytics. VMock could complement this by adding career pathway discovery to the onboarding experience.

## Automated Identity Verification & Fraud Prevention

CCC is deploying AI-powered spam filters and identity verification to combat enrollment fraud. This signals comfort with AI-powered tooling at the system level — reducing the "AI adoption friction" barrier for VMock.

## ERP & SIS Modernization

Transitioning from fragmented, college-level systems to a collaborative model. This modernization creates the technical foundation for system-wide tool deployments like VMock.
