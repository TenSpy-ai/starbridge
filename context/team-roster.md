# Team Roster — Starbridge GTM

## Leadership

{{UNVERIFIED: Slack handles below are inferred from Henry's Slack posts — confirm exact handle format. Real Slack handles are typically @lowercase or @firstlast (not "First Last"). If Clay/Datagen automations use @-mentions to tag BDRs, these MUST match the actual Slack member IDs or the mentions will silently fail.}}
