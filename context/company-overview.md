# Company Overview — Starbridge.ai

## What Starbridge Is

Starbridge is an **AI-powered GTM intelligence platform for public sector sellers**. It helps vendors selling into government and schools find opportunities _before_ the RFP, identify buying signals, track contracts/spend, enrich accounts/contacts, and draft proposals.

The platform is organized around **"Bridges"** — automated workflows that surface relevant business signals from government and institutional data sources.

## Market

**SLED**: State, Local, and Education procurement — a $1.5T+ market characterized by fragmented data, long sales cycles, and messy public records.

## Moat

Two defensible layers:

1. **Data moat**: Contracts, purchase data, FOIA-sourced records. They run FOIA campaigns that continuously expand their proprietary dataset (data flywheel).
2. **Tech moat**: AI that scans and summarizes board docs, meeting transcripts, agendas, and minutes — surfacing buying intent before procurement formally begins.

## Funding

- **$10M seed** — early Feb 2025
- **$42M Series A** — Oct 2025, led by Craft Ventures (with Owl, Autotech, Commonweal, etc.)
- Seed → Series A in the same year = strong pull signal from investors.

## Platform Scale {{UNVERIFIED: numbers below are from Starbridge dashboard UI observations — may change as platform grows}}

| Data Source | Volume |
|---|---|
| Meeting records (board minutes, agendas) | 107M+ |
| Purchase/contract records | 107M+ |
| RFP opportunities | 44.3K+ |
| Conferences tracked | 1,314+ |
| Buyers in database | 296K+ |

## Product Surface

- **Bridges**: Saved searches that auto-surface signals (RFPs, board meetings, purchases, contacts, job changes, custom web signals)
- **Ask Starbridge**: AI chat for researching buyers (key contacts, procurement strategy, priorities, competitors)
- **RFP Writer**: Proposal generation from uploaded RFP documents
- **Signals section**: Meetings, Purchases, RFPs, Conferences, Buyers — all searchable and filterable
- **Integrations**: Notion, Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Zendesk, Intercom, Sharepoint, Freshdesk

## GTM Engine (Project Endgame)

Starbridge runs a high-volume outbound machine where proprietary signals drive email campaigns via Smartlead. Currently scaling toward 3.3M emails/month across a TAM of 33K accounts (T0–T3) and 412K+ prospects.

Current conversion: ~0.7% prospect → positive reply (2.8x better than FY25's 0.25% average). PR → Meeting conversion: ~50%. {{UNVERIFIED: these numbers are from Henry's Slack "state of the union" post — confirm if still current}}

## CEO & Culture

Henry describes the CEO as "eccentric and floaty and excitable and hippy." Strong inbound interest but too many leads to handle — which is partly why the outbound automation matters (they need scalable systems, not more people).

## Key Differentiator for GTM

Starbridge's signals are not generic intent data. They come from **primary public sources** (board transcripts, meeting minutes, FOIA records, contract databases) that competitors can't easily replicate. This makes outbound messaging credible and defensible — you can say "we saw X in your last board session" with receipts.
