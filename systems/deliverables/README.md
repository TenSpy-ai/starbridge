# Deliverables — Intel Report Formats

## Overview

The "deliverable" is the intel report — the artifact a prospect actually sees after replying positively. It's the single most tangible output of the entire pipeline and the thing that either builds credibility or loses the deal.

There are two eras:

| Era | Format | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Legacy** | Gamma-generated deck/page | Active (being replaced) |
| **Future** | Branded landing page via {{TBD: Notion / Super.so / Webflow}} | Being built (V1 target: Friday 2/7) |

## Why the Format Matters

The intel report is NOT an internal document — it's a **sales asset sent directly to prospects**. A prospect at a government agency or school district receives this link. It needs to:

1. **Look credible and professional** — SLED buyers are skeptical of vendors; sloppy reports kill trust
2. **Be self-contained** — the prospect may forward it internally to a committee or decision maker
3. **Surface actionable intelligence** — not just data, but "here's what this means for you"
4. **Load fast and work on any device** — government IT often means locked-down browsers and slow connections
5. **Be deterministic** — same inputs should produce same outputs (Gamma fails this)

## What Goes in the Report

Content grows by version:

### V1 (MVP — Supabase signals only)
- Report header: company name, date, Starbridge branding
- Top 5–10 intent signals with SLED Signal Bullets (contextual summaries)
- Brief relevance summary connecting signals to the prospect's world

### V2 (Enriched — adds Starbridge API data)
- Everything in V1, plus:
- Decision maker contact card (name, title, email, phone)
- Budget / spend data (most valuable attribute per Justin)
- Account logo
- Buyer location
- Buyer type classification
- Branded template from Nastia's design

### V3 (Full — adds LLM analysis)
- Everything in V2, plus:
- Relevancy analysis (connecting specific signals to prospect's situation)
- Suggested pitch angle
- Procurement navigation guidance for this buyer
- AI Adoption Score {{UNKNOWN: methodology not defined}}
- Similar customers section {{UNKNOWN: matching logic not designed}}

## Report Delivery Flow

```
Report generated by Datagen
  │
  ├──→ URL sent to Clay (webhook return)
  │
  ├──→ Clay sends URL in Slack #intent-reports (Message 2)
  │
  ├──→ BDR includes URL in payload email to prospect
  │
  ├──→ BDR includes screenshot in email (visual hook)
  │
  └──→ Prospect clicks URL → sees the report
        │
        └──→ Prospect may forward URL internally to committee/DM
```

The report URL is the single artifact that flows through every channel: Slack, email, phone talk track, and potentially snail mail.
