  "report_markdown": "# \ud83d\udcca Luzerne County Community College \u2014 Intelligence Report for VMock\n\n> **\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Luzerne County Community College** | Higher Education\n\n> **State:** PA | **City:** Nanticoke\n> **Procurement Score:** N/A | **Fiscal Year Start:** N/A\n> **Website:** [luzerne.edu](http://luzerne.edu)\n> **AI Adoption Score:** 45/100 \u2014 Open posture; piloting AI through curriculum (micro-credentials in AI Fundamentals, Prompt Engineering) and campus-wide AI policy, but no large-scale operational deployments yet.\n\n---\n\n### WHY THIS BUYER MATTERS\n\n- **Active Student Success governance creates a natural champion for career tools.** The Board of Trustees maintains a dedicated Student Success & Workforce Development Committee that regularly reviews enrollment reports, graduate surveys, and student engagement \u2014 exactly the metrics VMock's career readiness assessments would improve. A BDR can reference this committee as proof the institution has formal governance around student outcomes.\n\n- **$48.4M approved budget with aggressive technology modernization underway.** The board approved a $48.4M operating and capital budget for 2024-2025 alongside an RFP for an Online Orientation Platform, a Computers & Technology Hardware Replacement Plan (Bid #513), and Infrastructure as a Service \u2014 signaling both budget capacity and institutional appetite for new digital student-facing tools like VMock.\n\n- **New executive leadership is resetting institutional priorities.** President John Yudichak's recent appointment creates a window where new initiatives can gain traction before institutional inertia sets in. Combined with the Strategic Plan 2022-2026's explicit goal to \"leverage technology to automate workflows and facilitate all student and staff communications\" (Goal 5.1), VMock can position as a quick win for the new administration.\n\n---\n\n### KEY CONTACT\n\n**Dr. Dana Charles Clark** \u2014 Provost & Vice President of Academic Affairs \u2014 dclark@luzerne.edu\n\n---\n\n### RECENT STRATEGIC SIGNALS\n\n**Student Success & Workforce Development Committee Governance**\nThe Board of Trustees convenes a dedicated Student Success & Workforce Development Committee that reviews enrollment trends, graduate surveys, curriculum changes, and student engagement data. The October 2023 session included recommendations for curriculum additions and modifications alongside a student engagement survey \u2014 indicators that the institution is actively measuring and iterating on student outcomes. VMock's career readiness analytics could feed directly into this committee's reporting cycle. *(Board Meeting, Oct 2023)*\n\n**Online Orientation Platform Procurement**\nIn 2024, LCCC issued an RFP for a comprehensive, scalable, and accessible online orientation platform for new student onboarding. This signals institutional commitment to digitizing the student experience from day one \u2014 a natural adjacency for VMock's AI-powered career prep tools that could extend the digital onboarding journey from orientation through graduation. *(RFP, 2024)*\n\n**$48.4M Budget with Technology Hardware Replacement**\nThe board approved a $48.4M operating and capital budget for 2024-2025 alongside technology hardware replacement initiatives, demonstrating both fiscal capacity and active investment in campus technology infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Buyers\n\n**University Of South Carolina Columbia** | Higher Education\n- **Top Signal:** Career Acceleration Platform \u2014 AI-Powered SaaS Licenses procurement\n- **Key Contact:** Brian Alden \u2014 Associate Director of Communications \u2014 aldenb@mailbox.sc.edu\n- **Relevance:** Active buyer of AI-powered career SaaS platforms, directly aligned with VMock's core offering.\n\n**University Of Wyoming College Of Law** | Higher Education\n- **Top Signal:** Sole Source Notification \u2014 Cloud Career Services Platform\n- **Key Contact:** Laurie Kempert \u2014 Executive Business Manager \u2014 kempert@uwyo.edu\n- **Relevance:** Already sole-sourcing a cloud career services platform, signaling budget authority and willingness to procure career tech.\n\n**University Of Wyoming** | Higher Education\n- **Top Signal:** Sole Source Notification \u2014 Cloud Career Services Platform\n- **Key Contact:** Anne M.
