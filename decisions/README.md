# Decisions — Architecture Decision Records

Lightweight ADRs for key architectural and strategic decisions. These prevent re-litigating choices that have already been made and provide context for anyone joining the project.

## Format

Each ADR follows: **Context → Decision → Reasoning → Consequences → Status**
